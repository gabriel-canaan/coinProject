CoinProject is the beginings of an app used to track cryptocurriencies in real time.

As a user I want to input the Abbreviation for a cryptocurriency's token ETH, DOGE,LITE ect. and have the search return 
display the value vs USD over a 24h period.
The data is coming from cryptocompare's api and nodule, using "Victory" to display in line graph form and 'moment' to convert unix time into standard 24h

A work in progress, noticably CSS free and an issue displaying the x axis time values in convienient divisions. 


Clone the repo
